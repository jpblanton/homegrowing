growth stages - might be worth adding a day/night time temp option
    have to track when the lights are on/off and what time it is
    growth stage would also need to track the lighting option (18/6 or 12/12)

post_save tag in GrowthStageHistory should give a way to send a message
and let the task know it needs to fetch a new value
    maybe in the tasks.py file it can load the value, aka when the server is started up
    then the task just needs to check a flag from settings
    start off GROWTH_STAGE_CHANGED = False
    !!!!!! this needs to be in redis
    when new hit to GrowthStageHistory table, send change that to True
    if it's true in the task, update value, set to False

logging
#celery for checking current status
figure out connection issues with local/containerized mosquitto broker
send out mqtt messages
models for high and low temp/humidity



look into using redis for messaging with devices since we'll need it for celery
