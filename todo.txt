tests!!!!!

1/12: mosquitto seems to be working...not sure if metric insertion is

raspberry pi branch with build: context . network: host & line to download rust & put in $PATH

basic display at least 
    front page drop down (growth stage) that only superuser james can edit but everyone can view

growth stages - might be worth adding a day/night time temp option
    have to track when the lights are on/off and what time it is
    growth stage would also need to track the lighting option (18/6 or 12/12)

logging
    set up done - need to put statements in code
    handling errors send over mqtt from devices

figure out connection issues with local/containerized mosquitto broker

adjustable temp/hum ranges
    new model (maybe one for each?) - form on the front page just like history
    when a new GrowthStageHistory is inserted it adds a new record with its parameters
