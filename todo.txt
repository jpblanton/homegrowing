tests!!!!!

fan2 doesn't seem to be working but fan1 is good
maybe it would be "better" for the fans View to update the status in the db
and then have a post-save signal to send the mqtt message

figure out how to get grafana showing in a page so we can keep the navbar
ooh navbar should have quick icons for temp and humidity
add sensor_view for easier access


restore those scripts that monitor memory & cpu usage
or prometheus? investigate that



look into shrinking the celery and asgi containers
    definitely don't need all the requirements, will that shrink?


growth stages - might be worth adding a day/night time temp option
    have to track when the lights are on/off and what time it is
    growth stage would also need to track the lighting option (18/6 or 12/12)


adjustable temp/hum ranges
    new model (maybe one for each?) - form on the front page just like history
    when a new GrowthStageHistory is inserted it adds a new record with its parameters
