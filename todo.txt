tests!!!!!

get heater set up and add topics
add migration for two main periodic tasks
    last celery_beat migration: 0016_alter_crontabschedule_timezone.py
    last celery_results migration: 0011_taskresult_periodic_task_name.py
kinda nervous about this one

put something in cleanup for device to send out status update
    this way it should only run when I change it in admin panel and not when changed normally

figure out how to get grafana showing in a page so we can keep the navbar
ooh navbar should have quick icons for temp and humidity
add sensor_view for easier access


restore those scripts that monitor memory & cpu usage
or prometheus? investigate that


model for devices?: location, device, name (location+device), status, last_updated

look into shrinking the celery and asgi containers
    definitely don't need all the requirements, will that shrink?

put this under is_authenticated for now since im only user
    front page drop down (growth stage) that only superuser james can edit but everyone can view

growth stages - might be worth adding a day/night time temp option
    have to track when the lights are on/off and what time it is
    growth stage would also need to track the lighting option (18/6 or 12/12)

logging
    set up done - need to put statements in code
    handling errors send over mqtt from devices

adjustable temp/hum ranges
    new model (maybe one for each?) - form on the front page just like history
    when a new GrowthStageHistory is inserted it adds a new record with its parameters
