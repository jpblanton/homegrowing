tests!!!!!

binary switch icon for device statuses on homepage

restore those scripts that monitor memory & cpu usage
or prometheus? investigate that

humidifier-control couldn't connect to mqtt at first
maybe too crowded at beginning? might need to add a waiting thing
	added depends_on to docker compose hopefully that fixes it

model for devices?: location, device, name (location+device), status, last_updated

look into shrinking the celery and asgi containers
    definitely don't need all the requirements, will that shrink?

put this under is_authenticated for now since im only user
    front page drop down (growth stage) that only superuser james can edit but everyone can view

growth stages - might be worth adding a day/night time temp option
    have to track when the lights are on/off and what time it is
    growth stage would also need to track the lighting option (18/6 or 12/12)

logging
    set up done - need to put statements in code
    handling errors send over mqtt from devices

adjustable temp/hum ranges
    new model (maybe one for each?) - form on the front page just like history
    when a new GrowthStageHistory is inserted it adds a new record with its parameters
